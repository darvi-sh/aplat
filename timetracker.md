30 min initial vue setup + trying to get gql running

1 hour watching gql crash courses

1 hour of gql playground

2 hours of setting the gql server

1 hour of setting up vue layout, pages and components

2.5 hours of figuring out how to query with params from vue client

- Turns out I was missing to match `($which: MachineWhereUniqInput!)`
- It was mentioned in the Apollo's error
